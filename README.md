This video describes the code used to make a Function Unit out of Verilog with includes tying together an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and a Shifter. Simulations were done for proof of concept but this series aims to program an FPGA with each part to ultimately build a microprocessor. Follow along as we go. See below for the code and helpful links. Have a great day and don't forget to Love Well!!</p>
